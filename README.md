## About the Author

Davis Smith earned his Masterâ€™s Degree in Philosophy from Arizona State University and is an adjunct Philosophy professor at three colleges, Pierce College, Bellevue College, and Olympic College. 
He specializes in teaching introductory level courses. One of his goals in teaching is to make Philosophy
accessible to all people. The cost and quality of textbooks are under-discussed obstacles to accessibility which Mr. Smith seeks to remove. His other textbooks are: 

- [ ] [forallx: R<sup>3</sup>](https://github.com/ProfDavisSmith/forallxR3#readme) A Remixed, Revised, and Reimagined Introduction to Formal Logic
- [ ] [Questions We Have](https://github.com/ProfDavisSmith/QuestionsWeHave#readme) An Introduction to Philosophy 

Outside of his OER textbooks, his current projects relate to the plausibility of libertarian free will, the philosophy of rhyme, and the philosophy of profanity.
