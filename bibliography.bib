ABSTRACT = {This paper sheds light on the treatment of the ‘problem of evil’ and human suffering from an Islamic perspective. I begin by providing an overview of the term ‘evil’ in the Qur’an to highlight its multidimensional meaning and to demonstrate the overall portrait of this notion as it is presented in the Islamic revelation through the narrative of the prophet Job. Having established a Qur’anic framework, I will then provide a brief historical overview of the formation of philosophical and theological debates surrounding “good” and “bad/evil” and the origination of Muslim theodicean thought. This will lead us to Ghazālian theodicy and the famous dictum of the “best of all possible worlds” by one of the most influential scholars of Islamic thought, Abu Ḥāmid Ghazālī. The final section of this paper will explore the Sufi/ mystical tradition of Islam through the teachings of one of the most distinguished mystics of Islam, Jalāl al-Dīn Rūmī. The conclusion of the paper will attempt to bring about a new understanding of how the so-called “problem of evil” is not presented in Islam as a problem but rather as an instrument in the actualization of God’s plan, which is intertwined with human experiences in this world—an experience that is necessary for man’s spiritual development.},

 abstract = {This essay refutes the widely held view that the Mohist doctrine of inclusive care (jian ai 兼爱) rules out any special preference for those close to us, especially family. Family values such as filial piety were in fact extremely important for the Mohists, as is clear even in their writings on inclusive care. Caring inclusively involved taking up a social perspective by committing oneself to collective norms that, if widely followed, would secure everybody's well-being. This would not be a pure form of altruism, since many people would be able to care inclusively for others only if they could in turn benefit from other people's care. This distinguishes the inclusive from the truly benevolent, who would remain benevolent regardless of how other people treat them. Understood, as it is argued here that we should, the Mohist doctrine of inclusive care provides a compelling account of how we should concern ourselves with one another's well-being in a society in which caring attitudes are sufficiently widespread.},

@article{BackYoungsun1,
abstract = {One of the core doctrines of Mozi is his teaching on jian'ai, and this is discussed primarily in the three chapters bearing this term in their title. The term "jian'ai" and its theme also appear scattered throughout the Mozi, such as in chapters like Standards and Rules and the Intention of Tian. Jian'ai has been translated into English as Universal Love, Inclusive Care, Impartial Care, and other similar phrases. As these various translations suggest, there is not yet a prevailing consensus on the exact meaning of jian'ai. Despite his renowned clarity and simplicity and his skill at argumentation, those who try to pin down Mozi's teaching on jian'ai soon encounter difficulties. In addition to these difficulties, another obstacle to deciphering Mozi's jian'ai is Mengzi's criticisms of Mozi. The author have tried here to make sense of Mozi's doctrine of jian'ai and argued that Mengzi's simple appraisal of love without distinctions cannot capture the complexity of Mozi's thought.},

 abstract = {InAztec Philosophy, James Maffie reveals a highly sophisticated and systematic Aztec philosophy worthy of consideration alongside European philosophies of their time. Bringing together the fields of comparative world philosophy and Mesoamerican studies, Maffie excavates the distinctly philosophical aspects of Aztec thought.Aztec Philosophyfocuses on the ways Aztec metaphysics-the Aztecs' understanding of the nature, structure and constitution of reality-underpinned Aztec thinking about wisdom, ethics, politics,\ and aesthetics, and served as a backdrop for Aztec religious practices as well as everyday activities such as weaving, farming, and warfare. Aztec metaphysicians conceived reality and cosmos as a grand, ongoing process of weaving-theirs was a world in motion. Drawing upon linguistic, ethnohistorical, archaeological, historical, and contemporary ethnographic evidence, Maffie argues that Aztec metaphysics maintained a processive, transformational, and non-hierarchical view of reality, time, and existence along with a pantheistic theology.Aztec Philosophywill be of great interest to Mesoamericanists, philosophers, religionists, folklorists, and Latin Americanists as well as students of indigenous philosophy, religion, and art of the Americas.},
