\emph{Who Should I Be? What Should I Do?} by Davis Smith is, for the most part, an original introduction to Ethics textbook. It covers the most common content in an introductory level Ethics course but also covers less common topics and perspectives, such as Feminist Consequentialism, Mohist Consequentialism, and pre-colonial Nahuatl Virtue Ethics. Aside from the original content provided by Davis Smith, this text also includes primary source material:

\begin{enumerate}
\item The Challenge of Cultural Relativism by James Rachels
\item Why I am an Objectivist about Ethics (and Why You Are, Too) by David Enoch
\item The Moral Status of Bloodbending by Davis Smith
\item The Moral and Legal Status of Abortion by Mary Warren
\item I was Once a Fetus by Alexander Pruss
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Credits for Some of the Content, Images, and Typesetting}

Smith, used under the \href{https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/}{CC BY 4.0} license. The typesetting for Questions We Have was, in turn, based on the code used for \forallx: \emph{$R^3$} by Davis A. Smith, used under a
